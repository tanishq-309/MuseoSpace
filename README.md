# 🎨 MuseoSpace — Virtual Art Exhibition

Welcome to MuseoSpace, an immersive web-based virtual art exhibition that transforms a traditional online gallery into a cinematic storytelling experience. This project simulates the journey of a visitor through a curated exhibition, using scroll-driven transitions, interactive artworks, and user engagement, all built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project was built for a hackathon with the constraint of using **no frameworks or databases**.
